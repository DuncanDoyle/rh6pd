<WARNING>
This file at the moment is not even remotely useful, someone needs to help me out and write documentation here. It is a .txt file at the moment, but it might make sense to convert to RST, MD, TeX or some other silly format so that it can be "compiled" into PDFs, docbooks, html and yet more silly formats.
</WARNING>

Files from rh6pd are installed into /opt/rh6pd with the .RPM distribution, otherwise the contents can be extracted anywhere.

1. Installation for BRMS (rh6pd-businessRules)
----
1.1 Installing the Model
Put the jar into the BRMS lib directory of the server.

1.2 Installation of the Guvnor artifacts
Using the eclipse plugin is probably the easiest for now. We should ship a repo export in the future though.

2. Installation for Basic Web Interface (rh6pd-webJsInterface)
----
Just put the .war for the webJsInterface into a Java EE server - pretty much anything will do. For simplicity, suggest using the application server that the BRMS Platform runs on.
