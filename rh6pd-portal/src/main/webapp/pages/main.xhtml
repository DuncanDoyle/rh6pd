        <h2>RH6PD Quote Portlet</h2>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates adding ajax processing and updating to standard JSF components combined with RichFaces 
            components.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example below, we have a rich:select component with options loaded from rh6pdQuote.greetings and 
            standard JSF inputText with a nested ajax tag. Both components 
            trigger an ajax request on every change. The values are sent
            to the server where the backing bean is updated, and the "output" panelGroup is re-rendered, without
            requiring a full-page refresh.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form labels and buttons use localized labels from resource bundles which we have declared in 
            WEB-INF/faces-config.xml
        </p>
        <p>
            To see this example in action, change the greeting or begin typing in the input box, and watch as your text is echoed with
            html generated from the application server using an ajax call.
